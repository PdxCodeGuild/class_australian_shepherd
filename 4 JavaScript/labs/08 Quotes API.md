# Lab 9: Random Quote


Use the [favqs.com](https://favqs.com/api/) api to show a random quote. To start, use `https://favqs.com/api/qotd` to `GET` a quote, then display it on the page.

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "author": "Albert Einstein",
  "body": "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.",
  ...
}
```


## Version 2

The API also supports browsing quotes. You can use the `page` and `filter` parameters to get a bunch of quotes. You can add page buttons and/or a text `input` field and `button` for filtering.

`"https://favqs.com/api/quotes?page="+page_id+"&filter=" + text`.

Then you can show those quotes in a list.Note that if the text has spaces or special characters will have to encode the parameters using [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) which takes a string and returns a new encoded string.

In order to get authorization for this request, we need to add a request header with the authorization token using [setRequestHeader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/setRequestHeader). You'll have to create an account with FavQs, then go [here](https://favqs.com/api_keys) to get an API key.

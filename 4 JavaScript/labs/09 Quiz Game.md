# Lab 9: Quiz Game


Use the following api https://opentdb.com/api_config.php and Vue.js to create a web app that lets a user play a quiz game. The user will be given a question and possible selections. Keep track of if the user gets the question right or wrong and let them continue playing with multiple questions.


## Features:
##### Use Axios params to handle the different parameters.
##### Keep a running score.
##### Tell the users the correct answer when they are wrong.
##### Have the user select the questions category. Either general or specified.
##### Have the user select the quiz difficulty.


### NOTE:
##### It is wise to make the number of question parameters multiple on first building the app to make the number of answers standardized to 4.


### Optional Game Logic:
##### Make the game so that if the user gets too many questions wrong they "lose" the game with a score screen at the end. 
##### For example, if the user misses two questions in a row, they "lose".

# Mini Capstone

For your final Python project, build a program that solves a problem or accomplishes a task. Your program needs to utilize an external API.  

The functionality of the program is up to you -- use this as an opportunity to get creative. Sometimes students explore an idea they want to use for their capstone project or solve an actual problem they have. For a list of free APIs [checkout this github repo](https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists). To make things easier, try to pick an API that does not require an API key (the auth column is No).

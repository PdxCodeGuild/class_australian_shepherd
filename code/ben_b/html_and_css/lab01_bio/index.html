            <p>She met The Narrator at a testicular cancer victims support group, which she went to despite obviously
                having never had that affliction. She also went to to other support groups, but for reasons other than
                The Narrator's. She went to the groups because they were "cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee."
                This caused great distress to The Narrator, who had her agree to not go to the support groups in the
                same days as him. <br/>
                She didn't hold the agreement, though: when The Narrator left the support groups for Fight Club, she
                took notice of his absence.

                                <p>A.C. Monza is a professional football club that is based in Monza, Lombardy, Italy.
                                    The team
                                    plays in the Serie A, the first tier of Italian football, following promotion in the
                                    2021–22
                                    Serie B season. The club was founded in 1912 (first lineup pictured), with its first
                                    recorded win on 20 September 1912. On multiple occasions in the 1970s, the club came
                                    close
                                    to promotion to the Serie A, but were twice declared bankrupt, in 2004 and 2015.
                                    Following
                                    Silvio Berlusconi's 2018 takeover of the club, Monza was promoted to the Serie B in
                                    2020
                                    after a 19-year absence; no Italian team had played more Serie B seasons (40)
                                    without
                                    playing in the Serie A. Monza have won the Coppa Italia Serie C a record four times,
                                    the
                                    Serie C championship four times, and an Anglo-Italian Cup. Monza's colours were
                                    initially
                                    blue and white but were changed to red and white in 1932; as a result, they are
                                    nicknamed i
                                    biancorossi ('the white and reds'). They have played home matches at the Stadio
                                    Brianteo
                                    since 1988.</p>

                                <p>Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8 September 2022) was Queen
                                    of the
                                    United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in
                                    2022.
                                    She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime and 15 at the time
                                    of her
                                    death.[b] Her reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British monarch,
                                    the
                                    longest recorded of any female head of state in history, and the second-longest

                                    reign of any sovereign in history.<br>
                                    Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first
                                    child of the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth).
                                    Her father
                                    acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII,
                                    making
                                    Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to
                                    undertake
                                    public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial
                                    Service. In
                                    November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and
                                    Denmark, and
                                    their marriage lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children:

                                <p>Rotavirus is a genus of double-stranded RNA viruses in the family Reoviridae.
                                    Rotaviruses are
                                    the most common cause of diarrhoeal disease among infants and young children.[1]
                                    Nearly
                                    every child in the world is infected with a rotavirus at least once by the age of
                                    five.[2]
                                    Immunity develops with each infection, so subsequent infections are less severe.
                                    Adults are
                                    rarely affected.[3] There are nine species of the genus, referred to as A, B, C, D,
                                    F, G, H,
                                    I and J. Rotavirus A, the most common species, causes more than 90% of rotavirus
                                    infections
                                    in humans.[4]<br>
                                    The virus is transmitted by the faecal-oral route. It infects and damages
                                    the cells that line the small intestine and causes gastroenteritis (which is often
                                    called
                                    "stomach flu" despite having no relation to influenza). Although rotavirus was
                                    discovered in
                                    1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron micrograph images[5] and accounts
                                    for
                                    approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and
                                    children,[6]
                                    its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health
                                    community,
                                    particularly in developing countries.[7] In addition to its impact on human health,
                                    rotavirus also infects other animals, and is a pathogen of livestock.[8]</p>

                                <p>NASA Astronaut Group 2 also known as the Next Nine and the New Nine, was the second
                                    group of
                                    astronauts selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
                                    Their
                                    selection was announced on September 17, 1962. The group augmented the Mercury
                                    Seven.
                                    President John F. Kennedy had announced Project Apollo, on May 25, 1961, with the
                                    ambitious
                                    goal of putting a man on the Moon by the end of the decade, and more astronauts were
                                    required to fly the two-man Gemini spacecraft and three-man Apollo spacecraft then
                                    under
                                    development. The Mercury Seven had been selected to accomplish the simpler task of

                                    flight, but the new challenges of space rendezvous and lunar landing led to the
                                    selection of
                                    candidates with advanced engineering degrees (for four of the nine) as well as test
                                    pilot
                                    experience.<br>
                                    The nine astronauts were Neil Armstrong, Frank Borman, Pete Conrad, Jim Lovell,
                                    James
                                    McDivitt, Elliot See, Tom Stafford, Ed White, and John Young. The Next Nine were the
                                    first
                                    astronaut group to include civilian test pilots: See had flown for General Electric,
                                    and
                                    Armstrong had flown the X-15 rocket-powered aircraft for NASA. Six of the nine flew
                                    to the
                                    Moon (Lovell and Young twice), and Armstrong, Conrad, and Young walked on it as
                                    well. Seven
                                    of the nine were awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.</p>

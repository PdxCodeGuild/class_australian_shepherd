        <p>We traveled to <span id='span_country'></span> to see a <span id='span_animal'></span>. The trip was extremely long as we traveled by <span id='span_vehicle'></span>, it took us almost <span id='span_number'></span> <span id='span_measure'></span> to get there. Luckily I was traveling with <span id='span_name'></span> and we were able to watch <span id='span_movie'></span> when we got there. Sadly, there wasn't enough people around to play <span id='span_sport'></span>, we ended our trip early.</p>

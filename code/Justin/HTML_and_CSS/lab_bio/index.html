    <br />
    <p>
      Born in the 8th Millennium B.C., the God Emperor is an immortal telepath,
      who has watched and guided mankind throughout it's history. Throughout his
      years, he had decided that all of humanity that had spread across the vast
      reaches of Space during the Dark Age of Technology. It was at this point
      he began creating his army, through genetic splicing, he created his sons,
      the Primarchs, as well as forging the gene-seed which all Space Marines
      would be enchanced with. This began his great war across numerous planets
      and galaxies wiping the Xenos out of existance, so that man may live
      peacefully.

      However strong willed the Emperor of Man is, this did not stop the forces
      that control the Warp to infect his sons with Chaos. Thus began the Horus
      Heresy, which would result in his defeat against the Traitor legions
      assualt on Terra (formally Earth). However, even as his life hangs on by
      but a thread, he continues to guide and protect the Imperium of Man from
      his Golden Throne, not truly being alive or dead now. This does not stop
      his powerful telepathic mind from continuing to guide and protect humanity
      from all that would try to destroy it now.

          Hello all, my name is <span class="name">Justin Graham</span>. I'm
          going to tell you a little about myself and how I got here. It starts
          with spending a good deal of my adult life trying to figure out what I
          wanted to be when I grew up.

        <p class="main2">A Brief History</p>
        <p class="info">
          It all started with MySpace HTML...then I went to the Marine Corps and
          decided I didn't want to work with computers. Then...it all started
          again with a few college classes in Cyber Security, and in that
          cirriculum, I had to take Data Programming. My first true introduction
          to development started with Python, and I've been hooked ever since.
        </p>
        <p class="info2">
          Since my first CS class I haven't stopped pushing myself to better my
          understanding of programming. From college courses, to self learning,
          all the way to bootcamp, I have decided this is what I want to be when
          I grow up.

            MTG_Informer is an app I built using Python. It pulls information
            from multiple APIs such as the card image, card price, deck lists,
            as well as where to buy it. I ended up using Kivy to create the GUI
            for this app, which was something I had never worked with before.

            short bio here:     Chuck Norris is so fast, he can run around the world and 
            punch himself in the back of the head. Chuck Norris can win a game of Connect 
            Four in only three moves. Chuck Norris originally appeared in the "Street Fighter II" 
            video game, but was removed by Beta Testers because every button caused him to do a 
            roundhouse kick. When asked bout this "glitch," Norris replied, "That's no glitch.".

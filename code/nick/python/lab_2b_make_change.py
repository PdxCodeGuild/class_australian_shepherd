# Lab 2b Make Change
# Let's convert a dollar amount into a number of coins. The input will be the total amount, 
# the output will be the number of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies. 
# Always break the total into the highest coin value first, resulting in the fewest amount of coins. 
# First convert the dollar amount (1.36) into the total number of pennies (136), then use floor division //, 
# which throws away the remainder. 10/3 is 3.333333, 10//3 is 3.

            I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
            Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
            I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
            The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
            I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
            I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
            See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
            And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
            I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
            I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
            What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
            Called "I Miss The Old Kanye, " man that would be so Kanye
            That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
            And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

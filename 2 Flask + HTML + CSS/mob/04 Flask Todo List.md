# Flask Todo List

Let's build a simple todo list with Flask.

## Part 1

- Using a `form`, allow the user to save a new todo item to the database. This should include a `input` for text, a `select` for the priority, and a `button` for submitting the form.
- Store added todos into a list.
- Display those todos in the browser.

```html
<ul>
  <li>walk the dog (high)</li>
  <li>butter the cat (medium)</li>
  <li>wash dishes (low)</li>
</ul>
```

## Part 2
- Add styles to each todo to display its priority, e.g. style high priority todos as red.

## Part 3
- Add the ability to complete a todo
- These can be styled with a line through them

## Part 4
- Add the ability to delete a todo
